In order to develop the project for the course of Deep Learning, our group was proposed to apply some of the topics covered during the classes and address it to a real- world problem of interest. Since all three of us are amused by sports, more particularly, football, we consider attractive to apply a model that could, in a certain way, explained the less randomness component of the game. Having this in mind, we chose to develop both Densely Connected Network model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network capable of predicting the league table, at the end of the season, of the top 10 European Leagues. To do so, we used data about teamâ€™s match statistics in respect to the league where they compete, from season 2014/15 until 2018/19 in order to predict the current unfinished season. Said that, we are under a regression problem, in which we propose to predict average number of points per game and, therefore, knowing the total number of league matches throughout the season we are then able to predict the league table ranking.
Firstly, we started by constructing the dataset, which implied a lot of research, data preparation and preprocessing work. In more concrete terms, we explored our dataset by performing some data preparation such as missing values treatment and outliers' recognition, which was followed by some modifications to the dataset by transforming and creating new relevant variables, standardizing the data and applying feature selection, in order to provide relevant and meaningful information to the model.
Subsequently, after the repetitive and exhaustive process of training the model and having reached a final solution, we applied the neural network models to unseen data, that is, current data available of season 2019/20 before the coronavirus outbreak stoppage.
